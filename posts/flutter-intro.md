Flutter let's you design pixel perfect mobile applications that are App store and Google Play ready. Code in one language and ship in the same day. Flutter is more robust than React native or standard mobile development while also not relying on primitive system specific components.

## Installation 

Install it [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Check for installation success by running flutter docter from your shell

``` 
flutter doctor
```

## Create and run a simple Flutter app
To create your first Flutter app and test your setup, follow these steps:

Create a new Flutter app by running the following from the command line:

```sh
 flutter create my_app
 ```
A my_app directory is created, containing Flutterâ€™s starter app. Enter this directory:

```sh
 cd my_app
```

To launch the app in the Simulator, ensure that the Simulator is running and enter:

```sh
 flutter run
```
