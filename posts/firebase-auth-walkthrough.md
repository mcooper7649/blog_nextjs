## What is firebase?

Firebase concept is simple. When you build a client-side app with JavaScript or any of its frameworks, for instance, Google Firebase can turn this into a serverless app in no time. It also removes the need to manage databases yourself, as it does that for you.

## Cons of Google Firebase

1. If not properly managed, the cost of maintaining Firebase on a pay-as-you-go service accumulates as reads and writes increase. So maintenance costs can spike at some points.
2. It's hard to export data stored in Firestore into another database. Even if you eventually find a way, it often requires a high level of technicality. Plus, it can be quite costly, too.
3. It can be less platform-agnostic, as it delves more towards Android than iOS.
4. The larger the query result gets, the messier and slower things become.

## Noteables

- With Firebase, it's pretty simple to connect and use built-in third-party authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among others.
